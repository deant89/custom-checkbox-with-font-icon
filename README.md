Custom checkbox with icon font (cross-browser fix)
==============================
Create custom radio buttons and checkbox using HTML5, CSS3 and Font Awesome icons easily (this fork does not use Font Awesome for the radio as I found it causes some issues cross browser).

-Fix for cross-browser. This will remove the usage of Font Awesome icons on the radio buttons. I was having issues with this cross-browser on MAC / PC / Chrome / IE etc, here is my fix using background / border CSS instead of the Font Awesome Icon.
